### 🚩 **Why this specific request is essential (the reasoning)**:

* You're clearly stating you want **a self-contained, fully autonomous local agentic loop**: no external hosting, no APIs, no paid services.
* You explicitly ask for **free, permissively licensed models** (CodeLlama, WizardCoder, Mixtral, etc.) because you want no restrictions, no signup, no cost.
* You’re clearly specifying tools you actually need, not vague generalizations (FAISS, Qdrant, HuggingFace Transformers, AutoGPT/BabyAGI, DeepSpeed).
* You directly state that the system must run and train continuously, **self-monitoring and self-correcting**, without you prompting or interacting constantly.
* You're explicitly forbidding arbitrary context limitations. Instead, you demand intelligent **vector-based retrieval** for effectively "unlimited" context.
* You ask explicitly for error catching, execution feedback loops, and continuous improvement cycles fully automated, simulating your manual workflow of fixing and retrying code—but without you sitting there doing it.
* You make it clear you need an **agent** that continually integrates your pre-existing dataset automatically, understands and contextually leverages your entire historical chat corpus to fine-tune the LLM progressively.
* You're forcing the model/system you create to leverage your powerful hardware, CPU & GPU explicitly listed, fully and correctly—no misaligned resource usage.
* You're explicitly directing the system to gradually and independently assemble your grand-scale project (Global HPC, decentralized peer-to-peer internet) from scratch, correcting itself autonomously, no human babysitting required.

---

### 🚩 **Practical Steps / What the LLM Should provide clearly (the deliverable)**:

You must insist explicitly that the LLM provides you:

* A **step-by-step guide**, understandable by someone who is not a programmer, for:

  1. Installing and configuring all required software (dependencies, databases, runtimes).
  2. Ingesting and indexing your prepared dataset (`json_to_aios_dataset_wizard.py` output) into the embedding/vector DB.
  3. Selecting the correct free LLM to fine-tune/train, with no hidden limitations or signup requirements.
  4. Automating the initial fine-tuning, and then ongoing improvement loops locally.
  5. Automatically managing code execution, terminal reading, debugging, iterative refinement, and detailed documentation.
  6. Providing the fully autonomous continuous loop setup:

     * Train → Infer → Generate Code → Test → Debug → Improve → Loop indefinitely
  7. Instructions for viewing progress, stopping and restarting safely, and monitoring system health or errors clearly.

* A **bootstrap script** (Python or Bash), that upon execution:

  * Installs all dependencies.
  * Sets up the environment perfectly.
  * Imports and indexes your prepared datasets automatically.
  * Initiates continuous training and code-generation loops without further action from you.

* The system explicitly leveraging GPU acceleration (RTX 4090 CUDA), CPU parallelization, RAM, and available storage intelligently.

* A working **local chat interface** you can use to interact directly with your trained model at any time without extra setup.

---

### 🚩 **Recommended explicit wording to use**:

> "Do **NOT** leave placeholders or require further prompts.
> **Everything** you provide must be 100% executable, instantly actionable, and **fully automated** for a non-programmer.
> You must clearly list **every single step, command, and explanation** so I don't need any further clarification or additional searches online."

---

### 🚩 **Avoid vague requests—explicitly ask for complete actionable deliverables only**:

* Do **not** ask for general ideas or explanations.
* Do **not** ask for demonstrations or examples.
* Do **not** let the LLM “scaffold” or “suggest” multiple alternatives.
* **Insist** on final, definitive choices upfront.

---

### 🚩 **How to keep the LLM accountable**:

* Regularly reiterate explicitly: "No generalizations, no placeholders, no scaffolds, no examples—just working automation."
* Explicitly ban boilerplate: "Do not produce boilerplate code that needs manual completion."
* Require immediate operational deliverables: "Every step you describe must lead directly to something executable and complete."

## A) End-to-End Scope (nothing omitted)

1. **Installer & Environment**

* Windows 11 → **WSL2 Ubuntu 22.04** provisioning (one reboot handled).
* NVIDIA stack: driver check, **CUDA 12.x** install, **PyTorch wheels pinned** to CUDA version.
* **Miniconda env** creation with pinned package versions; local wheel cache.
* **.wslconfig** tuned (CPU, RAM, swap) to prevent OOM/thrash.
* Power plan: **sleep disabled**, USB selective suspend off (GPUs), Windows Defender exclusions for work dirs.
* Disk checks: free space verification; log/dataset directories created; **log rotation** configured.

2. **Hardware Utilization**

* **4090** reserved for training/inference; **1660** for embeddings/preprocess; no mixed parallel for v1.
* GPU/CPU affinity and caps; watchdog to prevent runaway VRAM/CPU.

3. **Data Ingestion & Indexing**

* Validate your wizard outputs; **schema checks**; corrupt line quarantine.
* **Chunking rules** (size/overlap), language tags, dedup (hash/cosine).
* **Embeddings** (GPU) → **FAISS index** (on NVMe); index integrity report.

4. **RAG Chatbot (Local)**

* Retriever + re-ranker (optional) + generator; **citations required**.
* Web UI (Gradio/Streamlit): chat, search, citations, “open source doc” button.
* Latency budget & batching; GPU inference verified on 4090.

5. **Autonomous Agent Loop**

* Planner + codegen + **sandboxed execution** (Docker or isolated WSL workdir).
* **Tests first**: task specs → unit/CLI tests → acceptance criteria.
* Loop: generate → run → parse stderr → patch → retry (budget/timeout/circuit-breaker).
* **Git-tracked workspace**, auto-commit on green; auto-rollback on regressions.

6. **Fine-Tuning (QLoRA)**

* Curated slices (quality gates) from your dataset.
* Pinned training recipe, **resume-safe checkpoints**, eval harness (pass\@k on canned coding tasks; doc QA accuracy).
* Checkpoint rotation & disk quotas.

7. **Orchestration & Reliability**

* systemd services inside WSL2 (or supervisord) for: retriever, chatbot, agent loop, trainer.
* **Health checks** (heartbeats), auto-restart, exponential backoff, **crash reports**.
* Metrics summary page: GPU util/VRAM, CPU, RAM, queue, successes/failures, ETA.

8. **Dashboard**

* Start/Stop big loops; logs viewer; metrics; config editor; “open workspace” button; kill-switch.

9. **Security & Safety**

* Agent sandbox **no internet egress** by default; path allow-list.
* Secrets store; never hardcode tokens; no writes outside work dirs.

10. **Packaging**

* **NSIS/Inno** installer: preflight, idempotent re-run, rollback, uninstall.
* “Launch now?” post-install; opens dashboard. No manual steps.

---

## B) Likely Failure Modes → Preemptive Engineering (bypass now)

1. **CUDA / PyTorch mismatch**

* **Bypass:** Lock exact CUDA + PyTorch wheels; post-install `import torch; torch.cuda.is_available()` gate; fail fast with remedial path.

2. **Mixed GPUs (4090 + 1660) instability**

* **Bypass:** Do not split a single model across them. Pin **GPU0=4090** for model; **GPU1=1660** only for embeddings/preproc workers. Enforce by device IDs.

3. **WSL2 starving on RAM/swap**

* **Bypass:** Write `.wslconfig` (e.g., memory=200GB, processors=28, swap=150GB, localhostForwarding=true). Validate on first boot.

4. **Long-running jobs die on sleep/updates**

* **Bypass:** Set “High performance”, disable sleep; services with `Restart=always`; periodic heartbeat; **auto-resume** on reboot (systemd `WantedBy=multi-user.target`).

5. **Dirty dataset → garbage training**

* **Bypass:** Quality gates before training: max length, language filter, profanity/code-red flags, dedup via simhash, “broken-json quarantine”. Only green samples go to train.

6. **Agent infinite loop / file-system thrash**

* **Bypass:** Hard budgets: max iterations/test cycles per task; timeout per run; **circuit breaker** on repeating stack traces; auto-escalate to “ask for different approach” template. Use **git diffs** to block no-op or oscillating changes.

7. **Package drift & env hell**

* **Bypass:** Single conda env; a **lockfile** (explicit versions); build a local **wheel cache** on install; never `pip install -U` at runtime.

8. **Disk exhaustion (checkpoints, logs, indices)**

* **Bypass:** Quotas & rotation: keep N checkpoints; logs rotate daily to 7 days; alert at 80% disk; refuse new jobs at 90% until archived.

9. **Security / arbitrary code risks**

* **Bypass:** Sandbox run directory; no network egress; resource limits; reviewable whitelists for external calls.

10. **UI goes blank / port collisions**

* **Bypass:** Static port planning; liveness/ready endpoints; reload without restart; if port busy, increment predictable range.

11. **Model licensing / gated downloads**

* **Bypass:** Only permissive, **no-login** models; mirror download with checksums; cache models locally once.

12. **Bitsandbytes / GPU kernel compile issues**

* **Bypass:** Pin a **known-good bnb build** for CUDA 12; preflight test that quantized adapters load; fallback to CPU offload with warning.

13. **Windows file path edge cases (spaces, long paths)**

* **Bypass:** Use WSL paths under `/mnt/d/...`; normalize; test on path with spaces; set `LongPathsEnabled=1` if needed.

14. **Thermal throttling / instability**

* **Bypass:** GPU power cap setting optional; watchdog for persistent 100% temp; auto-pause training if temp > threshold.

15. **RAG hallucination without citations**

* **Bypass:** Force retriever-first; reject generation if no top-k above similarity threshold; show sources inline.

---

## C) “Say this exactly” — Comprehensive Demands (copy/paste blocks)

**1) Installer & Platform**

* “Deliver a **single Windows installer (.exe/.msi)** that: sets up **WSL2 Ubuntu 22.04**, installs/pins **CUDA 12.x + PyTorch matching wheels**, creates a **conda env** with **pinned** versions, writes a tuned **.wslconfig**, disables sleep, sets Defender exclusions, and validates `torch.cuda.is_available()` and `nvidia-smi` inside WSL. **No manual steps. No placeholders.**”

**2) Hardware Utilization**

* “Pin **GPU0 (4090)** for inference/training; assign **GPU1 (1660)** to embeddings/preprocessing only. Enforce by device IDs. Provide a toggle in the dashboard.”

**3) Data Pipeline**

* “Validate my dataset outputs: schema checks; corrupt-line quarantine; strict dedup (hash + cosine). Chunk with fixed window/overlap; tag language/source; embed on GPU; build **FAISS** with integrity report. On failure, abort with a precise remediation log.”

**4) RAG Chatbot**

* “Local web UI with chat + citations; fast generator on 4090; top-k retrieval with similarity threshold; deny answers without evidence. Show latency metrics.”

**5) Agent Loop**

**9) Security**

* “Sandbox execution; path allow-list; no writes outside workspace; no network egress; secrets vault.”

**10) Packaging & Acceptance**

* “Installer must be **idempotent**; safe re-run; clean uninstall. Provide **acceptance tests** that verify each component automatically. If any test fails, install aborts with guidance.”

**11) No Options, No Scaffolds**

* “Do **not** propose alternatives. Do **not** leave TODOs. Everything must be **final, pinned, reproducible, and unattended**.”

---

## D) Acceptance Tests (must pass automatically)

* **GPU stack:** `nvidia-smi` + `torch.cuda.is_available()` true inside WSL; run a tiny GPU matmul; pass.
* **.wslconfig applied:** memory/CPU caps read; swap file present; pass.
* **Data gate:** N inputs processed; Q quarantined; dedup ratio reported; pass thresholds.

* **Phase 2 (Day 3–4):** Agent loop with sandbox/tests/rollback; 24-hour soak; acceptance checks.
* **Phase 3 (Day 5):** QLoRA small slice + eval harness; checkpoint; integrate metric displays.
* (If needed, swap 2↔3; fine-tune can be day 4–5.)

---

## F) Non-Negotiables (repeat these)

* **Pinned versions only.**
* **No internet egress for agent.**
* **No manual steps anywhere.**
* **Abort fast on any preflight failure with an exact remediation log.**
* **All components must be restart-safe and resume-safe.**

---

















Got it. Below is the **complete, unambiguous request** you should issue to a builder (or LLM) so they can implement your **decentralized, volunteer compute network** with a **consumer-grade installer**, **capability grading**, **safe driver setup**, **intelligent scheduling**, **IO/BSOD protection**, and **clear UX**. I’m also listing the **failure modes** you will inevitably hit and the **preemptive engineering** they must include now (not later). Copy/paste the **DEMAND BLOCKS** verbatim.

---

## 0) One-sentence scope (to pin the target)

> “Deliver a **consumer-grade, one/two-click installer** and **web app** for a **global volunteer compute network** that safely onboards non-programmers, **benchmarks and grades** their hardware (CPU/GPU/RAM/Storage/Network/Uptime), **auto-configures drivers** (with consent), and **intelligently schedules** only compatible micro-tasks (ETL, embeddings, tests, media transforms, LoRA adapters) to heterogeneous, untrusted nodes—**with IO/thermal/BSOD guardrails**, **privacy-by-design**, **no optional steps**, and **full observability**.”

---

## 1) Architecture (non-negotiable)

* **Hub (your 4090 machine)**
  Scheduler, queue, artifact store (content-addressed), evaluator, FAISS shard merger, LoRA adapter merger, dashboard, identity/consent service.

* **Worker Agent (volunteer nodes)**
  Signed binary/installer + web UI. Outbound-only connection to Hub. Runs sandboxed tasks; auto-updates; reports capability/health; respects quotas.

* **Task classes**

  1. **CPU/Any**: hashing, JSON checks, chunking, dedup, unit tests, doc build.
  2. **Weak GPU** (1030/1060/1660/10xx/16xx): embeddings, small-model inference, image preproc.
  3. **Mid/High GPU** (2080/3090/4090/50xx/pro): LoRA micro-fine-tuning on small batches; heavier embedding shards.

* **Data movement**
  Ship **tiny inputs** + **deterministic task spec**; return **results + logs**; for training, **LoRA adapters only** (no full model weights).
  Keep private data central; volunteers see only public/synthetic/approved shards.

---

## 2) Benchmarking & Capability **Grading Model**

**Run during install (and on schedule):**

* **GPU**: detect vendor/model/VRAM/compute capability, TensorCore presence; measure FP16/INT8 matmul; **capability score** `G = f(TFLOPS_eff, VRAM, mem_bw, tensor_cores)`.
* **CPU**: multi-core FLOPS (OpenBLAS/FFTW), sustained for N seconds; `C = f(cores, base_clock, sustained_perf)`.
* **RAM**: bandwidth/latency (stream-like test); `R = f(GB, bandwidth, latency)`.
* **Storage** (per drive): random/sequential R/W, queue depth tolerance; SMART health; thermal throttling; **brand heuristic** (risky externals down-weighted); `S = f(type[NVMe>SSD>HDD>USB], seq, rand, health, throttle_flag)`.
* **Network**: up/down throughput, RTT to Hub, jitter; `N = f(down, up, rtt, jitter)`.
* **Uptime/Reliability**: rolling availability %, crash count, process restarts; `U`.
* **Thermal headroom**: temp under load vs limit; throttle risk flag.

**Composite score** (for scheduler routing):
`Score = wG*G + wC*C + wR*R + wS*S + wN*N + wU*U – penalties(thermal, BSOD risk, SMART warnings)`
(Baseline weights provided, editable from Hub.)

---

## 3) **Installer/Bootstrap** (Windows 11 priority; macOS/Linux later)

**DEMAND BLOCK — Installer:**

> “Provide a **single Windows installer (.exe/.msi)** that:
>
> * Provisions **WSL2 Ubuntu 22.04** (admin + reboot handled).
> * Detects NVIDIA/AMD GPUs. For NVIDIA: installs **CUDA 12.x**; pins **PyTorch wheels** to CUDA; verifies `nvidia-smi`+`torch.cuda.is_available()` **inside WSL**.
> * For AMD on Windows: **no ROCm** (unsupported); default these nodes to **CPU/weak-GPU tasks**; advise Linux path for ROCm.
> * Creates **conda env** with **pinned versions**; seeds local **wheel cache**; **no optional steps**.
> * Writes a tuned **.wslconfig** (mem/CPU/swap) and sets **High Performance** power plan; disables sleep; adds Defender exclusions for work dirs.
> * Runs a **benchmark suite** (GPU/CPU/RAM/Storage/Network), computes **capability scores**, and registers the node with the Hub.
> * Presents clear consent flows for driver/vendor installers (NVIDIA/AMD links/signatures), with **Yes/No** prompts only.”

---

## 4) **Storage & BSOD/IO Guardrails** (your Walmart-drive scenario)

**DEMAND BLOCK — Storage safety:**

> “Implement **per-device IO governors**:
>
> * Grade drives; set **IO throttles** by grade (max concurrent jobs, max queue depth, MB/s ceilings).
> * Detect SMART warnings, prior kernel crashes, USB instability; **down-rank** risky devices automatically.
> * For external USB HDDs and known fragile brands, enforce **conservative write burst** and **sync intervals**; prefer **read-heavy** tasks.
> * Run a **non-destructive soak test** (30–60 min low-intensity mixed IO); if errors/thermal throttling appear, automatically reduce limits and **flag device**.
> * Log all IO decisions; support live regrade.”

---

## 5) **Scheduler & Routing**

* **Match by capability** (GPU/CPU/RAM/Storage/Network/Uptime), data sensitivity, and **region proximity** (GeoIP).
* **Avoid stragglers**: small time-boxed tasks; **asynchronous aggregation**; speculative reassign after timeout; weighted retry.
* **Locality**: prefer nearest regions first; configurable fan-out; **hub orchestrated discovery** now; future-ready for DHT/gossip.
* **Task safety**: deterministic seeds; resource ceilings; expected schema; **idempotent task IDs**.

**DEMAND BLOCK — Scheduler:**

> “Deliver a capability-aware scheduler that:
>
> * Assigns tasks based on **Score** and **task class** (CPU/weak-GPU/high-GPU) and **region**.
> * Enforces **time budgets**, **memory/VRAM caps**, and **device-specific IO throttles**.
> * Uses **redundant execution** (k-of-n) for verification; **golden tasks** for trust; maintains a **reputation score** per node; down-ranks bad actors automatically.
> * Supports **asynchronous** completion (no global barriers), speculative re-assignment, and **merge on arrival**.”

---

## 6) **Task Types & Pipelines**

* **ETL**: hash, dedup (simhash), fix JSON, chunk, language tag, compression.
* **Embeddings**: GPU/CPU small-batch encoders; return vectors + shard metadata.
* **FAISS**: workers build shards; Hub validates/merges; OPQ/IVF optional.
* **Media transforms**: OCR/ASR/transcode/thumbnail with caps.
* **Tests/lint/fuzz**: project tests at scale with sandbox.
* **LoRA micro-tuning**: volunteers receive **tiny batches** + hyperparams; return **adapter deltas**; Hub merges (SVD/weighted), then re-evals.

**DEMAND BLOCK — Training:**

> “Implement **LoRA-only federated training**: workers never download full base weights; they upload **only adapter deltas**. Hub merges adapters, evaluates, keeps best; periodically distills into a consolidated adapter. **Never** attempt synchronous data-parallel over WAN.”

---

## 7) **Security & Privacy-by-Design**

* **Outbound-only** worker connections; **mutual TLS**; signed job specs; signed worker updates.
* **Sandbox** (container or restricted user): no filesystem escape; no internet egress for jobs; allow-list paths.
* **No sensitive data** shipped to volunteers; use public/synthetic shards.
* **Content policy**: disallow illegal content; auditing hooks.
* **Identity & consent**: explicit EULA; telemetry minimal/anonymized; withdrawals honored.

**DEMAND BLOCK — Security:**

> “Ship workers as **signed binaries**, use **mTLS**, outbound-only connections, sandboxed execution with **no egress**, allow-list FS. Never ship private data off-hub. Provide a consent/EULA flow and a way to purge node data on request.”

---

## 8) **Networking & Discovery**

* **Hub** provides worker bootstrap endpoints; workers register with capability + region.
* **Geo-aware** routing; **nearest first** selection; bounded fan-out for exploration.
* Future (optional): Kademlia DHT/gossip; but **do not** block v1 on P2P—centralized hub control plane is fine.

---

## 9) **Observability & UX**

* **Volunteer UX**:

  * Landing screen with score breakdown (GPU/CPU/RAM/Storage/Network/Uptime), estimated power draw, controls: **limit GPU %, pause, time windows**.
  * “What am I doing now?” pane; logs; credits/reputation; **privacy controls**.
  * **Update** mechanism; one-click uninstall.

* **Hub Dashboard**:

  * Live map/list of nodes; throughput, error rates, acceptance ratio, **cost per unit work**.
  * Start/stop task classes; adjust weights/quotas; emergency kill switch; audit trail.

**DEMAND BLOCK — Dashboard:**

> “Provide two UIs: (1) Volunteer app UI with capability score, current tasks, limits, pause schedule, credit/reputation; (2) Hub dashboard with live node metrics, throughput, error rates, accept/reject stats, scheduler config, kill switches, and audit logs.”

---

## 10) **Reliability**

* **Services**: systemd in WSL2 (or native on Linux), auto-restart with backoff; heartbeat; crash reports.
* **Reboot resilience**: auto-resume queued tasks; idempotent merges.
* **Resource guards**: temperature thresholds; VRAM/CPU caps; disk quotas and log rotation; pause on 90% disk.

---

## 11) **Legal/Governance**

* **Terms**: opt-in compute, power usage, data handling, logs anonymization, revocation.
* **Moderation**: deny abusive job types; blocklist.
* **Export control**: no restricted model weights to certain jurisdictions (builder to supply compliance switch).

---

## 12) **Acceptance Tests (must pass automatically)**

1. **Installer**: WSL2 provisioned; CUDA+PyTorch verified; conda env created; reboot handled; no manual steps.
2. **Benchmark**: scores computed; thermal/io flags set; device classes correct.
3. **Storage guard**: risky USB HDD auto-throttled; soak test logs; no BSOD during sustained IO test.
4. **Worker security**: outbound-only; sandbox/allow-list enforced; signed updates verified.
5. **Scheduler**: assigns 100 mixed tasks to heterogeneous simulated workers; meets SLA; reassigns stragglers; verifies outputs via redundancy.
6. **FAISS**: N shards merged; integrity and recall >= threshold.
7. **LoRA federated**: K adapters merged; eval improves baseline by Δ; bad adapters auto-rejected.
8. **Dashboards**: show live metrics, start/stop classes, node detail; volunteer can cap usage.
9. **Reboot**: hub/worker reboot → queued tasks resume; state consistent.
10. **Disk guard**: at 90% disk, new tasks paused; alert surfaced; operator can free space or override.

---

## 13) “Say this exactly” master block (copy/paste)

> “Build a **global volunteer compute system** with: a **consumer-grade Windows installer**, **benchmark grading** (GPU/CPU/RAM/Storage/Network/Uptime), **safe NVIDIA driver/CUDA setup** via WSL2, **AMD on Windows limited to CPU/weak-GPU tasks**, **capability-aware scheduler**, **storage/IO/BSOD guardrails**, **sandboxed outbound-only worker**, **verifiable micro-tasks**, **LoRA-only federated training**, **FAISS shard building/merging**, **privacy-by-design**, **signed binaries and mTLS**, **observability dashboards**, and **automated acceptance tests**.
> No optional steps, no placeholders, pinned versions, idempotent installs, auto-restart services, reboot resilience. If any acceptance test fails, the installer aborts with exact remediation.”

---

### Why this will save weeks

Because you’re **moving the engineering pain into up-front, pinned requirements and acceptance tests**. That’s what turns a “pile of scripts” into something non-programmers can install, understand, and safely contribute to.

If you want, I’ll turn this into a **formal spec PDF** (no code), or drop it into your canvas so you can hand it to any builder/LLM and get back the right deliverables. When you’re happy with the spec, I’ll generate the **installer and services plan** step-by-step.


Below are **direct DEMAND BLOCKS** for **security, encryption, UX + back-end coupling, and procedural ML orchestration**. Copy/paste as your requirements. **No placeholders. No options. Final deliverables only.**

---

## DEMAND BLOCK — SECURITY BASELINE (IN-TRANSIT / AT-REST)

* **Transport:** Enforce **TLS 1.3**, **mTLS** (client certs), certificate pinning, OCSP stapling, HTTP/2 or QUIC.
* **AuthN/Z:** JWT (short-lived) + refresh with **DPoP**/**mTLS** binding. Role-based + capability-based access control.
* **At-rest encryption:** All artifacts, indices, logs, caches encrypted with **AES-256-GCM**; keys rotated; per-tenant KMS.
* **Key management:** Local KMS on Hub with **TPM/DPAPI** (Windows) or **tpm2-pkcs11** (Linux). User secrets derived with **Argon2id** (salted, high cost).

* **Node identity:** Ed25519 keypairs per worker, signed by Hub CA; **device binding** to hardware UUID.

---

## DEMAND BLOCK — OPTIONAL EXTRA ENCRYPTION LAYERS (USER-CONTROLLED)

* **Encryption profiles:**

  1. **Standard** (AES-256-GCM envelope encryption)
  2. **Hardened** (XChaCha20-Poly1305 envelope + AES-256-GCM at-rest)
  3. **Paranoid** (N-pass cascading; user picks N; **local-only** pre-processing)
* **Client-side envelope encryption:** Per-file data keys (DEKs) generated locally; DEKs encrypted with user KEK; **Hub never sees plaintext DEKs**.
* **Local-only redaction pass:** PII scrub + user rules before any encryption: regex + ML NER + custom dictionaries.
* **Key rotation & shredding:** One-click rotate; cryptographic shred of old DEKs; verifiable deletion receipts.
* **No-plaintext mode:** Toggle to **never transmit plaintext**; tasks restricted to what can be computed under chosen profile.
* **Audit view:** Per-file encryption profile, passes applied, KIDs, and verification hashes.

* **Zero-retention toggle:** Do not store artifacts post-verification; ephemeral compute only.

---

## DEMAND BLOCK — UX: DATA SELECTION & CLASSIFICATION

* **Tags & sensitivity:** Auto-tag source/type/licensing/sensitivity; user can override.
* **Preview & redaction UI:** Show sample lines/frames; apply redaction rules live; estimate time/size after encryption.
* **Region policy:** Allow/deny regions; **strict mode** blocks assignment outside allowed list.

---

## DEMAND BLOCK — UX: TRAINING/INFERENCE WIZARD (NON-PROGRAMMER)

* **Top-level buttons:** **Train AI**, **Fine-Tune**, **RAG/Index**, **Embeddings**, **Code Generator**, **Chatbot**, **Speech**, **Vision**, **Agent (Computer Control)**, **Robotics**, **Simulations**, **Financial Modeling**, **Industrial**, **Gov/Mil**, **Custom**.
* **Goal selector:** User picks “What are you building?” → **Preset Templates** show required components.
* **Auto-plan:** System **auto-generates**: tokenizer choices, chunking schemes, data schemas, model family, quantization plan, training recipe (QLoRA/LoRA), eval suite, deployment target.
* **One-click build:** Generates all **machine-readable configs** (YAML/JSON), data manifests, trainer args, eval plans, and inference endpoints. **No placeholders.**
* **Data condition flags:** **Unorganized**, **Pre-processed**, **Tagged**, **Tagless**, **Web-scraped**, **Images**, **Media**, **Code**, **ML files**, **OS files** → pipeline adjusts automatically.

---

## DEMAND BLOCK — PROCEDURAL ML ORCHESTRATION (AUTO-GENERATION)

---

## DEMAND BLOCK — RESOURCE DONATION & CONTROLS

* **Contribution sliders:** GPU %, CPU %, RAM GB, IO MB/s, network up/down caps; schedules (e.g., 1am–6am).
* **Uptime goal:** Target availability; auto-pause when user is active.
* **Live meters:** Temp, power draw, VRAM/CPU/RAM usage; one-click **panic/kill switch**.
* **Priority modes:** **My projects first**, **Community first**, **Balanced**.

---

## DEMAND BLOCK — SCHEDULER & ROUTING (GLOBAL)

* **Capability routing:** Use composite Score (GPU/CPU/RAM/Storage/Network/Uptime) + region to assign tasks.
* **Asynchronous aggregation:** Time-boxed micro-tasks, speculative reassignments, merge on arrival.
* **Verification pipeline:** k-of-n redundancy, golden tasks; **auto-ban** cheaters; reputation-weighted assignments.
* **Region awareness:** Nearest-first; fan-out controls; **search expansion** jobs to discover more nodes.
* **Limits:** Per request, limit number of nodes; override with explicit consent.

---

## DEMAND BLOCK — TRAINING & INFERENCE (VOLUNTEER CONTEXT)

* **LoRA-only federation:** Workers receive small public batches; upload **adapters only**; Hub merges (SVD/weighted), re-evals, and version controls.
* **RAG & embeddings:** Workers build FAISS shards + metadata; Hub validates/merges.
* **Inference:** Large models centralized on Hub; small models optionally cached at edge nodes with expiry/invalidations.

---

## DEMAND BLOCK — LOGGING, AUDIT, COMPLIANCE

* **Immutable audit log:** Append-only ledger for consent, data movements, task assignments, cryptographic hashes, worker cert IDs.
* **Tamper-evident:** Hash-chained; periodic signed checkpoints.
* **Export:** One-click export of audit logs and data-use reports; per-jurisdiction compliance templates.
* **Retention policy:** User-configurable; zero-retention option; auto-purge schedules.

---

## DEMAND BLOCK — API & PROTOCOL REQUIREMENTS

* **Control plane APIs:** `/register`, `/capabilities`, `/lease`, `/heartbeat`, `/submit`, `/fetch-artifact`, `/revoke`.
* **Data plane:** CAS with signed URLs; chunked upload/download; resume; integrity checks.
* **Security:** mTLS on all control calls; signed job specs; signed worker updates; cert rotation protocol.

---

## DEMAND BLOCK — ACCEPTANCE TESTS (MUST PASS)

1. **Crypto verification:** TLS 1.3 + mTLS enforced; cert pinning works; revoked certs denied.
2. **Client-side encryption:** Standard/Hardened/Paranoid profiles produce different ciphertext; DEKs never transmitted in plaintext; rotation + shred verified.
3. **Redaction:** PII scrub removes seeded secrets; user rules applied; diff shows no leaks.
4. **Consent:** Region allow/deny enforced; ledger logs destinations; export equals on-wire destinations.
5. **Worker sandbox:** No internet egress; FS allow-list enforced; resource caps hold under stress.
6. **IO governor:** Risky USB HDD throttled; soak test runs with no kernel crash; logs show throttling decisions.
7. **Scheduler:** Mixed fleet simulation meets SLA; stragglers re-assigned; k-of-n verification catches injected bad results.
8. **Federated LoRA:** Adapters merged; eval improves baseline; malicious adapter rejected automatically.
9. **RAG/FAISS:** Shards merged; recall >= threshold; integrity hashes match.
10. **Wizard:** Selecting any use-case produces **complete configs**, starts jobs, and deploys endpoints/UI with **zero placeholders**.
11. **Resource controls:** Sliders enforce caps; kill switch stops all tasks instantly.
12. **Audit:** Tamper-evident chain passes verification; export works; retention deletes artifacts.

---

## DEMAND BLOCK — DELIVERABLES

* **Signed Windows installer (.exe/.msi)** with WSL2 setup, CUDA+PyTorch, conda env, benchmarks, and worker agent install.
* **Hub services** (scheduler, CAS, evaluator, dashboards) with pinned versions, systemd units, and health checks.
* **Volunteer app UI** (install + control) and **Hub dashboard UI** (orchestration + audit).
* **Procedural ML orchestration engine** generating all configs/recipes/evals/UI endpoints per selected goal.
* **Security artifacts:** CA, cert rotation tooling, KMS provisioning, key backup/restore docs.
* **Acceptance test suite** (automated) that fails install if any test fails.

Use these blocks as-is. If you want, I can convert this into a formal spec document for handoff.
